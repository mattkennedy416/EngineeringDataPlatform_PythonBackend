## Making Changes

Since the Backend Execution Helpers are being imported and executed in separate IPython processes, the package needs to be rebuilt for changes to be accessable. 


### To build:

 - Open a new Command Prompt (not an Anaconda prompt)
 - cd E:\Projects\DataPlatform\PythonBackend
 -  Run the bat script at:
    - E:\Projects\DataPlatform\PythonBackend\venv\Scripts
 - cd BackendExecutionHelpers
 - python setup.py install
