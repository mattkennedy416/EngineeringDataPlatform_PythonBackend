# Startup

In the current architecture there is a frontend service and a backend service. 
The backend service will start up additional processes to execute code in a safe and isolated environment. 


## Starting the Backend Service
Within this repository, start the main.py file. This will start up a Flask instance. 


## Starting the Frontend Service

This is in a separate repository:
E:\Projects\DataPlatform\ReactFrontend\lightence-ant-design-react-template-main

cd to the root directory and run:

>yarn start

in a browser window, go to:

> http://192.168.56.1:3000
